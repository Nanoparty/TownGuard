## Features

### Wave Based Combat

Defend the village from waves of fantasy monsters and prevent them from breaching the gate! Each wave will prove harder than that last, as the monsters attack in greater number and variety. Fight monsters with a variety of weapons, attacks, and evasion abilities as you test your skill against the enemy's blade!

### Fight Alongside Your Allies

Fear not, for you will not have to fight these battles alone! The town milita will charge into battle right by your side!

### Equipment Upgrades

The only thing mightier than the sword, is a bigger sword! Earn weapon upgrades as you advance through each wave of monsters!
